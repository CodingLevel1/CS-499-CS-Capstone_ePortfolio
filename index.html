    <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
    <p>Completing my coursework throughout the Computer Science program at SNHU, coupled with the development of my ePortfolio, has been an incredibly rewarding experience. 
        It has not only helped me acquire essential technical skills but also allowed me to showcase my strengths, refine my professional goals, and prepare myself for an 
        exciting career in the field of computer science. Throughout this journey, I’ve developed a well-rounded understanding of various computer science domains, 
        including algorithms, data structures, software engineering, and cybersecurity. This self-assessment serves as a reflection of my growth, both academically and 
        professionally, and provides a comprehensive overview of the skills I bring to the table.

        One of the most significant achievements in my academic career has been the development of my ePortfolio. This platform has allowed me to demonstrate 
        my capabilities in real-world software development, from creating secure systems to applying data structures for efficient solutions. As part 
        of my coursework, I completed projects such as developing a course planner using AVL trees in CS-300 Data Structures, implementing role-based 
        access control in CS-410 Software Reverse Engineering, and building interactive data dashboards in CS-340 Client/Server Development. These 
        projects have showcased my ability to design and implement computing solutions that solve real-world problems while managing performance, security, 
        and scalability.

        In addition to the technical skills I gained, the experience of developing this ePortfolio has greatly shaped my professional goals. By curating my best 
        work in one cohesive portfolio, I’ve been able to reflect on my journey and pinpoint key areas where I excel. It has helped me focus on my career 
        aspirations in IT support, cybersecurity, and software development, while also reinforcing my passion for building secure and scalable systems. 
        These projects not only showcase my technical expertise but also demonstrate my ability to communicate technical solutions clearly to stakeholders, 
        a skill that I have continuously refined throughout the program.

        One key aspect of the program that has been particularly valuable is learning to collaborate effectively in a team environment. Many of the projects 
        required working with peers, where we tackled complex challenges together. In doing so, I developed strong teamwork and communication skills that are 
        essential for professional growth in any computer science career. Whether it was breaking down tasks for a project or explaining technical concepts to others, 
        these experiences helped me improve my ability to work with diverse groups and ensure that we achieved our shared objectives.

        The coursework also emphasized the importance of data structures and algorithms, areas that are fundamental to any successful software solution. By working 
        with structures like binary search trees and AVL trees, I gained a deep understanding of how to optimize and organize data for better performance. Additionally, 
        I developed expertise in software engineering practices, from designing software systems to ensuring they meet security standards. My experience in databases, 
        particularly through my work with MongoDB in the CS-340 course, allowed me to understand the intricacies of managing and storing large datasets efficiently.

        Security has been a major focus of my education, particularly through my work in CS-410 Secure Coding. Implementing security best practices such as input 
        validation, encryption, and role-based access control has helped me develop a security mindset that is essential in today's world of growing cyber threats. 
        My ability to incorporate security into every layer of development, from front-end to back-end, will help me be a valuable asset to any organization looking to 
        protect their data and infrastructure.

        In this ePortfolio, the artifacts I have selected reflect the breadth of my capabilities. Each project demonstrates my technical skills in a specific area of 
        computer science, from software design and engineering to algorithms and data structures, and database management. The projects are complemented by my focus on 
        security, as seen in the enhancements I’ve made to address vulnerabilities in the software. By showcasing these artifacts, I hope to convey my full range of 
        abilities and demonstrate my readiness to contribute effectively to a professional environment.

        In conclusion, the Computer Science program at SNHU has equipped me with the technical knowledge, practical skills, and professional mindset needed to 
        succeed in the computer science field. My ePortfolio is a testament to my growth and accomplishments, and I am excited to continue building on these skills 
        as I move forward in my career. This journey has not only shaped my technical abilities but also my approach to problem-solving, collaboration, and 
        communication—skills that I am eager to apply in my next professional role.</p>

    <div class="project">
      <h3>CS-410 Software Reverse Engineering</h3>
      <p>Category: Software Design and Engineering</p> 
      <p>This project focuses on the implementation and optimization of key data structures and algorithms, particularly the Binary Search Tree (BST) and AVL Tree, 
        to manage a collection of course data for a course planner system. The goal of the project was to efficiently store, retrieve, and manage course data while 
        ensuring optimal performance in search and insertion operations, even with large datasets. The initial version of the project used a standard Binary Search 
        Tree (BST) but faced limitations in performance as the dataset grew. To address these limitations, I enhanced the program by implementing an AVL Tree, a 
        self-balancing binary search tree, to improve the efficiency of insertion and search operations. This enhancement reduced the time complexity of both operations 
        from O(n) in the basic BST to O(log n) in the AVL Tree, which ensures better scalability when handling large amounts of course data. This project highlights my 
        ability to apply algorithmic principles and data structure optimization in real-world scenarios. It also showcases my skills in addressing performance issues in 
        software applications and improving the overall user experience through better scalability.</p>

      <h3>CS-340 Client/Server Development</h3>
      <p>Category: Databases</p>
      <p>In this project, I developed a full-stack application that involved creating a client-server system with a focus on database interaction using MongoDB. 
        The project involved building an interactive dashboard that visualized and analyzed data for a specific application. The server-side was built using Node.js, 
        with MongoDB as the database management system, while the client-side used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display the data in an easy-to-read format. One of the 
        major challenges of the project was efficiently handling and querying large datasets in MongoDB. To optimize performance, I focused on using proper 
        indexing, ensuring that queries were executed quickly, and minimizing the response time for the end user. The project also featured a dynamic data table, 
        which allowed users to filter, sort, and search for specific data points.This project allowed me to demonstrate my database management skills and my ability 
        to design and develop client-server applications. It also showcased my experience in creating interactive and data-driven user interfaces, and I was able to 
        apply concepts of data manipulation and visualization learned throughout the course.</p>
