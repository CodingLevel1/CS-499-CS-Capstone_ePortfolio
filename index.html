    <div class="project">
      <h3>CS-410 Software Reverse Engineering</h3>
      <p>Category: Databases</p> 
      <p>This project focuses on the implementation and optimization of key data structures and algorithms, particularly the Binary Search Tree (BST) and AVL Tree, 
        to manage a collection of course data for a course planner system. The goal of the project was to efficiently store, retrieve, and manage course data while 
        ensuring optimal performance in search and insertion operations, even with large datasets. The initial version of the project used a standard Binary Search 
        Tree (BST) but faced limitations in performance as the dataset grew. To address these limitations, I enhanced the program by implementing an AVL Tree, a 
        self-balancing binary search tree, to improve the efficiency of insertion and search operations. This enhancement reduced the time complexity of both operations 
        from O(n) in the basic BST to O(log n) in the AVL Tree, which ensures better scalability when handling large amounts of course data. This project highlights my 
        ability to apply algorithmic principles and data structure optimization in real-world scenarios. It also showcases my skills in addressing performance issues in 
        software applications and improving the overall user experience through better scalability.</p>

      <h3>CS-340 Client/Server Development</h3>
      <p>Category: Databases</p>
      <p>In this project, I developed a full-stack application that involved creating a client-server system with a focus on database interaction using MongoDB. 
        The project involved building an interactive dashboard that visualized and analyzed data for a specific application. The server-side was built using Node.js, 
        with MongoDB as the database management system, while the client-side used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display the data in an easy-to-read format. One of the 
        major challenges of the project was efficiently handling and querying large datasets in MongoDB. To optimize performance, I focused on using proper 
        indexing, ensuring that queries were executed quickly, and minimizing the response time for the end user. The project also featured a dynamic data table, 
        which allowed users to filter, sort, and search for specific data points.This project allowed me to demonstrate my database management skills and my ability 
        to design and develop client-server applications. It also showcased my experience in creating interactive and data-driven user interfaces, and I was able to 
        apply concepts of data manipulation and visualization learned throughout the course.</p>
