      <h3>CS-410 Software Reverse Engineering</h3>
      <p>Category: Software Design and Engineering</p> 
      <p>This project focuses on the implementation and optimization of key data structures and algorithms, particularly the Binary Search Tree (BST) and AVL Tree, 
        to manage a collection of course data for a course planner system. The goal of the project was to efficiently store, retrieve, and manage course data while 
        ensuring optimal performance in search and insertion operations, even with large datasets. The initial version of the project used a standard Binary Search 
        Tree (BST) but faced limitations in performance as the dataset grew. To address these limitations, I enhanced the program by implementing an AVL Tree, a 
        self-balancing binary search tree, to improve the efficiency of insertion and search operations. This enhancement reduced the time complexity of both operations 
        from O(n) in the basic BST to O(log n) in the AVL Tree, which ensures better scalability when handling large amounts of course data. This project highlights my 
        ability to apply algorithmic principles and data structure optimization in real-world scenarios. It also showcases my skills in addressing performance issues in

          The aim was to enhance user access management and protect data within the software. The original project was functional but lacked robust security practices, 
          which made it a great candidate for improvement.</p>

      <p>Inclusion Justification:</p>
      <p>I chose this artifact for my ePortfolio because it demonstrates my ability to address real-world security concerns through the implementation of role-based access 
          control (RBAC), secure authentication, and logging of security events. These are crucial skills in software development, especially when managing sensitive data 
          or systems with multiple user roles. By enhancing the code, I introduced input validation, improved access control, and added logging capabilities to ensure that 
          unauthorized attempts were tracked, significantly improving the security features of the software.</p>

      <p>Course Outcomes:
      <p>The enhancements to this artifact align with Outcome 5 (Develop a security mindset) by focusing on the identification and mitigation of vulnerabilities within 
          the software, particularly in input validation and access control. Additionally, the project contributes to Outcome 3 (Design and evaluate computing solutions), 
          as it involved applying core security principles to improve functionality and user access management. These enhancements not only improve the security of the 
          software but also demonstrate my ability to adapt and implement security features in real-world software development.</p>

      <p>Reflection:
      <p>Through this enhancement, I learned the significance of incorporating robust security practices in software design. One of the challenges I faced was ensuring 
          that the input validation system handled edge cases properly, such as non-integer inputs and integer overflow. Additionally, implementing a logging mechanism 
          to track unauthorized access attempts proved challenging as it required me to balance the need for detailed logs with the risk of exposing sensitive information. 
          The process was a valuable learning experience and gave me hands-on practice with security principles, which will be essential in my career.</p>

      <div class="narratives">
      <h3>Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structures</h3>
      <p>Artifact Description:</p>
      <p>For this enhancement, I selected my artifact from the CS-300 Data Structures course, created in August 2024. The project involved using a Binary Search Tree (BST) 
          to manage course data for a course planner program. The program allowed users to load courses from a CSV file, store them in a tree structure, and print the 
          course list in alphanumeric order. Initially, the program worked well for smaller datasets, but as the dataset grew, I identified a need for improvement to 
          handle larger datasets more efficiently.</p>

      <p>Inclusion Justification:</p>
      <p>I included this artifact in my ePortfolio because it demonstrates my understanding of data structures and algorithms, specifically with the implementation of a 
          Binary Search Tree. As the dataset grew, I realized that the BST could lead to inefficient performance, which led me to enhance the program by switching to 
          an AVL tree, a self-balancing binary search tree. This change improved the program’s efficiency, particularly in insertion and search operations, by ensuring 
          that the tree remained balanced even as new courses were added.</p>

      <p>Course Outcomes:</p>
      <p>The improvements made to this artifact align with Outcome 3 (Design and evaluate computing solutions), particularly in applying algorithmic principles to solve 
          performance problems in data structures. By transitioning to an AVL tree, I optimized the program's search and insertion operations, demonstrating my ability 
          to manage trade-offs in data structure design. Additionally, this project contributed to Outcome 4 (Use innovative techniques and tools), as implementing the 
          AVL tree represents an innovative solution to improving the scalability and efficiency of the program.</p>

      <p>Reflection:</p>
      <p>This enhancement allowed me to deepen my understanding of self-balancing trees and their significance in optimizing performance. One challenge I encountered was 
          ensuring that the AVL tree remained balanced after every insertion, which involved implementing rotations. I had to carefully follow the AVL tree’s balance 
          factor rules and apply the correct rotations. I also faced challenges in ensuring that the program could handle invalid inputs when reading course data. Overall, 
          this project was a great opportunity to improve my problem-solving and algorithm optimization skills.</p>
